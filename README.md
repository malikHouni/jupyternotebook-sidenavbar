# jupyternotebook-sidenavbar

## Add a simple navigation side bar allowing to navigate within titles h1 from cells markdowned

## How to do it ?
just add in a cell the following:
<pre>
%%html
    <script src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/malikHouni/jupyternotebook-sidenavbar/master/sidenavbar-v0.1.js"></script>
</pre>

### future: 
It's really simple, maybe I'll add it as an extension later to the jupyter notebook env. I't the most logical next step.
Also, I'll change in the future the  css.

Please give feedback. Thanks !
